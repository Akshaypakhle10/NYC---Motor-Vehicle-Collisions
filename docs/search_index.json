So, it comes as no surprise that annual average(2012-2019) of motor vehicle collision(MVC) is north of 10,000. With about 1000 losing their lives and several thousands being hospitalized every year owing to such incidents. The city administration has taken several steps to curb MVCs after it reached an all time high of 149,218 crashes in 2015. Our analysis focuses on the impact of the Vision Zero program introduced by Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio , in 2014. We analyse the overall trends in vehicular collision in the state of New York. By measuring the effect of policies made by the city’s administration, we aim to provide insights to substantiate future policy updates. This analysis investigates: - Most frequent causes of accidents - Vehicle type involved in most crashes - Intersections that are most vulnerable to crashes - Increase in severity of crashes We have also created an interactive plot that helps in quick exploration of the distribution of crashes over time.

["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources This project explores the more recent data from NYC Open Data for Motor vehicle CollisionsData Set. This dataset can also be reached and interacted with through its Google BigQuery location ## [1] 1612178 32 The dataset consists of about 1.6 million reported incidents. We have about 29 features or decriptors for each data point. The names of these features and their data types are displayed below. ## [,1] ## ACCIDENT DATE &quot;Date&quot; ## ACCIDENT TIME Character,2 ## BOROUGH &quot;character&quot; ## ZIP CODE &quot;numeric&quot; ## LATITUDE &quot;numeric&quot; ## LONGITUDE &quot;numeric&quot; ## LOCATION &quot;character&quot; ## ON STREET NAME &quot;character&quot; ## CROSS STREET NAME &quot;character&quot; ## OFF STREET NAME &quot;character&quot; ## NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED &quot;numeric&quot; ## NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED &quot;numeric&quot; ## CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1 &quot;character&quot; ## CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2 &quot;character&quot; ## CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 3 &quot;character&quot; ## CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 4 &quot;character&quot; ## CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5 &quot;character&quot; ## COLLISION_ID &quot;numeric&quot; ## VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1 &quot;character&quot; ## VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2 &quot;character&quot; ## VEHICLE TYPE CODE 3 &quot;character&quot; ## VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4 &quot;character&quot; ## VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5 &quot;character&quot; ## DAY &quot;numeric&quot; ## MONTH &quot;numeric&quot; ## YEAR &quot;numeric&quot; The names are quite self-explainatory but a few notes have been highlighted below: - Depending on the number of vehicles involved in the crash the columns “CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2”, “CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 3”, “CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 4” and “CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5” may be missing. Similarly “VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2”, “VEHICLE TYPE CODE 3”, “VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4” and “VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5” could be missing for smaller crashes. - The columns “CROSS STREET NAME”, “OFF STREET NAME”, “ON STREET NAME”, “ZIP CODE” and “LOCATION” are redundant as well as less accurate and are hence not used for location based analysis. We instead use the latitudes and longitudes. It should be noted that the dataset does not report the exact corrdinate of the collision, instead, it reports the coordinates of the nearest intersection. - “NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED/KILLED” is the aggregation of the columns “NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED/KILLED” , “NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED/KILLED” and “NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED/KILLED”. We also use google static maps API to for plotting the spatial data. Instead of overlaying the image in the backgroud this gives us more control over the exploration. "],

This data set is then converted into subgroups and saved as jsons for the interactive D3 plots at github/karth2512. High-level spatial mapping in Plotly Data Cleaning Steps: - Removing anomalies in Latitude and Longitude values. - Converting the categorical columns into factors. - Converting the Date column into Date class. - Saving transformed data frame as csv There are certain latitudes and longitudes that are not part of the state of new york but are still part of this dataset. Since our analysis is only related to NYC, we drop these values by crosschecking the lat-longs with the boundaries of NYC. We create a subset by sampling 50,000 rows from the original data. This specificly comes in handy when the original dataset is unwieldy. "],
["missing-value-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 Missing Value Analysis 4.1 Why to analyse missing values? 4.2 Visual representation of missing values in dataset 4.3 Missing values pattern analysis: whole data 4.4 Missing values pattern analysis: location data 4.5 Missing borough analysis", " Chapter 4 Missing Value Analysis 4.1 Why to analyse missing values? In this section, we will try to analyse trends in missing values of the datset. It is important to analyse missing values’ trends as they might tell something about the question we are trying to investigate, and also to see if we will be able to investigate the questions under consideration. If the data required for investigation is missing, we will have to take the help of external data sources. In other words, inspecting the trends among missing values will give a direction to our investigation. 4.2 Visual representation of missing values in dataset This plot gives us a visual representation of how the missing values look in the dataset. On the y-axis, we can see the rows and on the x-axis we can see the columns. 29.4% of overall data is missing, which is represented by black colour in the plot. It is clear from the plot that columns related to different vehicles involved in the accident are among the ones with the highest missing values. This further reinforces our hypothesis in the previous analysis that majority of accidents involve at most 2 vehicles. There might be a possibilty that we are not able to visualise the columns which have less number of missing values. Thus, we will now look into the summary table for the missing values of the data. ## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## variable n_miss pct_miss ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 ACCIDENT DATE 0 0 ## 2 ACCIDENT TIME 0 0 ## 3 NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED 0 0 ## 4 NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED 0 0 ## 5 NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED 0 0 ## 6 NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED 0 0 ## 7 NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED 0 0 ## 8 NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED 0 0 ## 9 COLLISION_ID 0 0 This summary table gives us the number and proportion of missing values in each column. We can see that there are certain columns which do not have any missing values. These columns will help us in our analysis where we have to count the number of rows but the other columns are missing, thus facilitate in showing missing values or no values in other columns. Such columns can be COLLISION_ID, ACCIDENT DATE. 4.3 Missing values pattern analysis: whole data Here, we are starting by analysing the missing values’ patterns of the full dataset. Guidelines to interpret the graph: - Here, the horizotal bar chart (bottom-left) shows the total number of missing values in each column (written on it’s y-axis). - The lines with dots (in the graph at the bottom) shows the patterns in missing values. On the line, where dots are present, it means that all those corresponding columns (on it’s y-axis same as the previous point) are missing in that pattern. The number of missing values in that pattern is given by the vertical bar chart at the top. - The graph will get clearer in the analysis below. Using the plot, we are able to discern that: 1. The pattern where maximum number of values are missing is the one with “off street name”, “vehicle type code 3”, “vehicle type code 4”, “vehicle type code 5”, “contributing factor vehicle 3”, “contributing factor vehicle 4”, “contributing factor vehicle 5”, with a total of 630756 rows. This accounts for approximately 49% of the total values. This may mean that, generally, accidents include 2 vehicles. We can further look into it by getting the count of rows where all the vehicle related columns are missing to reinforce this inference. ## [1] &quot;Rows with 3, 4, 5 vehicles missing: 1352706&quot; ## [1] &quot;Total rows: 1475518&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percent: 91.676686&quot; After further investigation, it turns out that 91.7% of the data is consisted of accidents where at most 2 vehicles were involved. “Off street name” is the only column where the values in that column are missing when all the other columns are filled. Thus, it is clear that we cannot remove the missing values where “off street name” as it will lead to loss of information. There are certain rows where all the columns in the above plot are missing and we may have to look into these rows when we will start our investigation to see if we can/should remove these are not. 4.4 Missing values pattern analysis: location data Another important aspect of our analysis is location. Now, we will try to find out patterns in the location related columns to see what kind of trends emerge there, what columns we can rely on and what columns we can use to extract necessary information. There are 30020 rows in the data where no location related values are there. In this case we can drop the missing value rows and proceed with our analysis. However it is a strange and interesting observation that there is no location related information. This means that accidents are being reported there but there location is not. This may need a much deeper investigation which is out of the scope of this project, but may reveal interesting facts. 4.5 Missing borough analysis Now, we will be inspecting the data where boroughs are missing. This inspection reveals amusing results. When faceted on years, we can see that before 2016, the boroughs were missing along the main highways. One hyoothesis for this could be: these highways connect different boroughs or pass through different boroughs were not reported as a part of one borough. After (and including) 2016, borough values were missing inside the boroughs as well. Again, this investigation is out of the scope of this project, but may reveal some interesting results and can be investigated, in future. "],

Let us start by looking at the spatial orientation of the number of accidents by creating a density plot. We can clearly see for all the boroughs that the accidents are not evenly distributed and there are certain zones where the density is higher. This is one of the factors that gives way to our analysis. 5.1.1 Inference for Manhattan The higher density of accidents seem to be concentrated towards the Midtown-Downtown part of the borough. This might be due to high commotion at these locations. Firstly, these locations are have high population density which increases the chance of accidents, especially with people jay-walking. Secondly, a lot of offices are in these locations and there is a high probability of accidents during the rush hour as people come from different places to work. Thirdly, these locations have tourist attractions and that leads to more people coming to these locations from various places, leading to increased chances of accidents. Lastly, these locations (especially Midtown) have a lot of bars and other nightlife restaurants. People may be drinking and driving leading to higher density of accidents. 5.1.2 Inference for Queens: The highlighed zone in Queens’ plot is Flushing area which is densely populated and has popular spots, such as Queens’ library, SSA office, USPS etc. The library generally attracts more students and may lead to increased traffic because of them. Also, people and officials go to SSA office for official work and such places are generally crowded. For USPS, they generally have their delivery trucks coming in and going out, which contributes significantly to traffic. 5.1.3 Inference for Bronx: The highest density spot is marked by the merger of two popular expressways; the Sheridan expressway and Bruckner expressway. It becomes more clear now why this is a dense spot as merger of expressway act as bottleneck for the traffic, where people usually drive as faster speeds, than in the cities. 5.1.4 Inference for Brooklyn: The highlighted spot corresponds to the ending of Brooklyn bridge which connects Manhattan to Brooklyn. This is expected as at such bridge junctions, bottlenecks occur. Also, people from Brooklyn generally come to Manhattan for work or for other attractions. Thus, leading to increase in chances of accidents, especially during the rush hour. 5.1.5 Inference for Staten Island: In Staten Island, then accident prone areas seem to be Oakwood, Midland Beach, New Dorp, Richmond and Bay Terrace 5.1.6 Inference for Brooklyn: The highlighted spot corresponds to the ending of Brooklyn bridge which connects Manhattan to Brooklyn. This is expected as at such bridge junctions, bottlenecks occur. Also, people from Brooklyn generally come to Manhattan for work or for other attractions. Thus, leading to increase in chances of accidents, especially during the rush hour. 5.1.7 Inference for Staten Island: In Staten Island, then accident prone areas seem to be Oakwood, Midland Beach, New Dorp, Richmond and Bay Terrace 5.2 Which are the most accident-prone Boroughs? It is clear that over all these years, Brooklyn has had the most number of accidents with over 340,000 cases bring reported, followed by Manhattan with about 260,000 incidents. These numbers don’t really make a lot of sense, unless we bring in another parameter that would help us assess the most accident-prone out of all these borough. One such parameter that I can think of is Area of the Boroughs. Another could be Population Density. I’m going to find out the no. of accidents happening in each borough with respect to the area of each borough, i.e. Accident-Density. I’m going to manually create a list of the areas of the five boroughs, I could scrape it using rvest, but I feel its too much of an effort for just getting five values, so I prefer manual entries in this case. Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City. Well, turns out, although Brooklyn had the most number of accidents happening over the years, Manhattan has almost twice the accident-density than Brooklyn and well over thrice than the rest of the Boroughs. It explains a lot about what we see in the density plot of Manhattan, and that it is the most accident-prone borough out of all. 5.3 Analyzing accident trends over time. 5.3.1 How are the accidents distributed over Years? Firstly, since the dataset has comparitively less values for the year 2012, that’s why the bars for that year are significantly smaller than compared to the rest. This is probably because of the way the data was collected, and the amount of records that were digitized. It would only be fair to compare the trends from 2013 onwards as we have comparable amount of data over the rest of the years until 2019. We see that the no. of accidents were gradually increasing in almost all the boroughs(except Staten Island), over the years 2013-2015. We also see that there is a significant drop in the numbers in the year 2016, right after the year 2015 where the number of accidents were the highest. A further investigation into this led us to the “Vision Zero” program announced and implemented by the Mayor of NYC, specifically aimed at reducing traffic accidents and making the streets more safer for the people. Source : https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/013-17/vision-zero-mayor-de-blasio-2016-saw-fewest-fatalities-ever-new-york-city-streets/#/0 Although, the program did pretty well after the first year since its inception, there has been a steady rise in the years after it, specifically in 2017 and 2018. We’re still in 2019, and the data that we have are of the months until the start of November. Hence, it can’t be compared directly with the previous years yet. 5.3.1.1 What are the monthly trends of Accidents? The monthly trend does not change much except for the slight drop in April, the cause of which remains unknown. But we can speculate that the reason is because April marks the end of snowfall and increased daylight which improves the weather conditions and decreases the collisions. The number of collisions in the winter does not decrease ,although technically people tend to wander out less often in the winter. This is because the probability of collision increases in the winter owing to the rough weather which balances out the factor mentioned before to give a (almost) constant yield of crashes throughout the year. The distribution of accidents over hours of the day shows that most accidents occur during noon, between 11am and 12pm. This could be the result of delivery trucks which often go around the city during noon or because people wander out to grab lunch from their favourite restaurants. The amount of accidents slowly rise from 7AM to 9AM as people start their day and travel to their workplaces. The mild peak at 6PM to 7PM could account for people travelling back to their homes. The sudden rise at odd hours of 3am-4am is representative of people returning after enjoying their “nightlife”. 5.4 Are there any extreme accidents? We will now try to find out the accidents where significantly high number of people were killed or injured, and further try to investigate them. We can clearly see that there is one incidence when more than 25 pedestrians were injured. After looking through the data and investigating online, we were able to find a corresponding headline in The New York Times. This incident corresponds to May 18, 2017, when a car rammed into pedestrians in Time Square, killing 1 and injuring more than 20 people. (source: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/nyregion/times-square-crash.html) Next, we can see the most significant outlier of the plot, that is when more than 40 motorists were injured. After investigating online and browsing through the data, we were able to find out that this correponds to September 9, 2013 when an MTA bus collided with a car in Brooklyn. 40+ pepople inside the bus were injured. Since these people were inside the bus, they are considered in the category of motorists. (source: https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/09/brooklyn-bus-accident-leaves-at-least-6-injured/) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## BOROUGH `Victim Types` value ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 STATEN ISLAND NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED 3 ## 2 BRONX NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED 9 ## 3 MANHATTAN NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED 20 ## 4 QUEENS NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED 21 ## 5 STATEN ISLAND NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED 27 ## 6 MANHATTAN NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED 31 ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## BOROUGH `Victim Types` value ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 MANHATTAN NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED 15704 ## 2 MANHATTAN NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED 22009 ## 3 BROOKLYN NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED 22121 ## 4 BRONX NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED 26375 ## 5 QUEENS NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED 36231 ## 6 BROOKLYN NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED 66357 The stacked plot above does not reveal much about the extreme values as they get squashed due to scale. Thus we have presented a separate analysis below. As far as the distribution goes: Brooklyn leads in every parameter: Manhattan and Queens have quite similar distributions. Staten Island seems to rank low in all parameters owing to its low population The lowest values are of NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED in 4 of the 5 boroughs, this goes to prove that the measures taken to reduce fatal cycle collisions after 2016 has been effective. NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED are shockingly high in BROOKLYN, being nearly double the next highest borough, which is QUEENS. This calls for immediate policy changes to curb such collisions. 5.5 How bad were the accidents, and how many of them led to deaths? Although the most-accident prone out of all the boroughs was Manhattan, it’s evident that the most lethal(in terms of proportion of accidents causing deaths) of all the boroughs is Brooklyn. Even Queens, which had over 1/3rd of the accident-density than that of Manhattan, has a greater proportion of accidents that lead to deaths. This leads us to infer that even though Manhattan is the most accident-prone Borough, most of the accidents don’t cause deaths, infact upon further investigation on online sources, it is seen that many cases wherein there are quite a lot of accidents that lead to no/minor injuries, but they have to be reported to file for insurance claims of the vehicles and the victims involved. Also, another reason is that Manhattan is a pretty densely-populated area with highly regulated traffic rules and slow zones, which might be one of the causes that although this increases the probability of accidents happening, the impact of the collision of the vehicles at low speeds might not lead to deaths. 5.6 What are the actual numbers of Injuries/Deaths due to accidents over the years? We will plot the number of people killed or injured in the past years. We are able to see the trend for number of persons injured outweight the number of people killed, thus, we are not able to visualise the data of number of people killed. For this, we will create another plot just to visualise the number of people killed. We can see that there was a sharp increase in both, the number of people killed and in the number of people injured from 2012 to 2013. This might be because we have more data available from 2013, than from 2012. There was a decline in the number of persons killed from 2013 to 2016, and in the nunmber of persons injured from 2013 to 2015. Both the number have increased from 2016-2017. One trend which we can notice is that, when the number of people killed were on a rise from 2016 to 2017, there came a drop in the numbers from 2017 to 2019. This may be the outcome of the Vision Zero policy that was implemented by the government of NY in 2016, which aimed at reducing the number of fatalities and injuries during accidents. The number of people injured from 2016 to 2018 (not including 2019 as the year is still running) have increased, but it’s pace has greatly decreased compared to 2 years before that year, that is, the pace of increase in number of people injured has definitely slow down from 2017-2018, as compared to 2015-2017. A reason for this can be that under Vision Zero poilcy, governemnt decalred some slow zones with speed limit of 25mph. Thus, there were still accidents (indicating the slowed down number of injuries), but the impact of accidents was reduced because of the slow speed of the vehicles. Meaning, the accidents were not a fatal as they earlier were. Seems like th Vision Zero policy had a positive impact on the number of people killed/injured. Both the number have increased from 2016-2017. One trend which we can notice is that, when the number of people killed were on a rise from 2016 to 2017, there came a drop in the numbers from 2017 to 2019. This may be the outcome of the Vision Zero policy that was implemented by the government of NY in 2016, which aimed at reducing the number of fatalities and injuries during accidents. The number of people injured from 2016 to 2018 (not including 2019 as the year is still running) have increased, but it’s pace has greatly decreased compared to 2 years before that year, that is, the pace of increase in number of people injured has definitely slow down from 2017-2018, as compared to 2015-2017.

Thus, there were still accidents (indicating the slowed down number of injuries), but the impact of accidents was reduced because of the slow speed of the vehicles. Meaning, the accidents were not a fatal as they earlier were. Seems like th Vision Zero policy had a positive impact on the number of people killed/injured. 5.7 What are the most common causes? We’ve filtered out the most common and uninformative cause of accidents (Such as Driver Inattention/ Distraction, Failing to yeild Right of way ) and the rows where the cause is unspecified since these causes won’t help the analysis as much and actually do skew the distribution in a way that the other causes seem to become quite uninterpretable given the scale. After this, we find the most important cause to be Backing Unsafely, Following too closely, Passing too Closely, Turning Improperly, Traffic Conrol Disregarded, etc. all of which suggest that more often than not, these accidents are also directly related to the root cause of Driver Inattention/ Distraction or lack of traffic safety knowledge. Either ways, traffic rule awareness programs that emphasize on the importance of concentraing on the driving and being focused, and stricter actions against violations might help to lower such cases. We also see reasons such as Alcohol Involvement, Prescription Medication(Drugs) which are clear cases of violations of traffic rules, and point towards the need for greater enforcement and stricter fines in such cases. Finally, there are also reasons such as Pavement Slippery, View Obstructed/Limited (Mostly at turns and intersections) which suggest that the government could put some more efforts into improving the current infrastructure for Traffic Safety. 5.7.1 Are these causes common amongst all the Boroughs? Firstly, we do see a general pattern of the causes of accidents being common amongst all the borough, except for a few more interesting facts. Manhattan and Brooklyn have a surprisingly higher number of accidents caused due to ‘Lost Consciousness’, almost high enough to take that to about 6th rank in the overall list of causes of accidents. ‘Passing too closely’ becomes the third highest cause in Brooklyn. There are also a high number of cases of Passing or Improper Lane Usage in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Queens has a surprisingly high number, even higher than Manhattan of cases involved with Backing Unsafely. Other than the obvious maximum of consumer vehicles such as SUV and Sedans,the next in line are the commercial 4/6 wheelers, taxis and busses. The categories Sedans, SUV and Taxi account for most of the crashes but this is rooted on the fact that they are an aggregation of a large type of vehicles or , in other words ,represent a huge majority of the vehicles on the road. Thus, this graph does not divulge much information due to the aggregated nature of the categories, and we shall focus on the time and spatial analysis of the crashes. Let’s see the most accident-prone places in terms of no. of Accidents. Since, the data specifies that the police officer usually notes down the closest intersection of street and avenue, it would be logical to find out the most accident-prone places based on these parameters, and I think this is the best approximation that we can get given the data. 5.8 What are the overall Top-25 most-accident prone intersections? Now, we’re going to try and mark these places on the map, ordered in the format (Rank. Cross Street Name). Straight off the bat, its clearly visible that Staten Island has no cross-street within the 25 most accident-prone intersections. Another interesting observation is that clusters are seen in this graph, especially in Manhattan, wherein very specific regions have such a high no. of accidents reported. Surprisingly, 2nd Avenue(Manhattan) appears 5 times in this top 25 list, and particularly in a two specifically clustered regions, once in the (34th St. and 36th St. Cluster) and once in the (57th St and 59th St. Cluster). Also, Flatbush Avenue(Brooklyn) shows a similar trend, having a cluster of intersections that appear twice in the top 10. These are far too interesting observations to not dig deeper into, so I’m going to do exactly that, and hopefully find out the reason for this. I’m going to zoom in on the clusters in Manhattan, specifically on the four intersections i.e. 2nd and 3rd Avenue across 57-59th streets. Let’s see what else we can find out about these 4 intersections. It’d be interesting to see the types of victims involved in accidents at these intersections. It is very surprising, and very odd that there are absolutely no cases(or no records) of accident cases that led to injuries after 2016 at these four intersections, also 2016 was the year when Vision Zero when vision zero was started being implemented in NYC. It is probably a huge anamoly in the recording of the data, or some measures implemented in the programs have worked wondrefully. Either ways, we tried to dig into what might be causing these accidents and some of the reason that we found were: Location/Context: Heavy traffic leading to Queensboro Bridge. Land Use: Mixed use, ground floor commercial, high-rise residential Bus Routes: M15 SBS/Local Through Truck Routes: 1st Avenue, 57th Street Bike Routes: Potential route on 1st Avenue Issues Identified: - Heavy vehicle volumes - Long crossing distances Implemented Improvements: - Installed northbound left turn arrow on 1st Avenue to help organize turns and reduce pedestrian-vehicle conflicts - Modified signal timing (split phase) to accommodate heavy left turns - Installed pedestrian countdown signals - Installed “LOOK” safety pavement markings at crosswalks to alert pedestrians to oncoming traffic.

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations: 7.2 Future Work:", " Chapter 7 Conclusion From our exploratory analysis, we gathered quite a few interesting inferences which could prove to be useful in many ways. For example, we’ve found out some of the most accident-prone intersections, so maybe the authorities could take additional measures to tackle these areas and make them safer. We also saw that arterial slow zones in Manhattan might’ve led to lesser deaths due to accidents, although there’s a lot of room to improve on that aspect since the number of people injured went up. We also found out some interesting statistics related to time, months and years, which might be useful in planning and designing infrastructure and policies that account for these variables, and hopefully help decrease the number of accidents in NYC. The Vision Zero Plan(introduced in 2016) emphasizes “Arterial Slow Zones” - lowering speed limits on specific roadways - to reduce avoidable accidents. It seemed to be pretty effective when it was first implemented in 2016, significantly reducing accidents from the previous years, but it seems like the overall effectiveness of the plan is fading away as accidents have been consistently on the rise since then. The findings of this analysis could be used to check the effectiveness of the safety measures adopted under Vision Zero. Finally, we do know that this dataset has been very popular and there are lots of analyses available on the internet, but the challenges involved in doing these analyses such as the sheer amount of variables and observations, is what drove us to give this a shot, and by no means, this is a complete analysis, but we believe its a good start and could turn into something worthwhile if explored a bit more deeper, like we tried to do in the last part of our analysis. 7.1 Limitations: The analysis is only as good as the data that we have, which in turn is only as good as provided by the Transport and Accident Management System updated by the NYPD. This presents the most important issue of approximate location data. It points towards the fact that a particular crash incident location information is mapped to the nearest intersections and the location coordinates may not always represent the actual location of the crash. Hence this assumption needs to be accommodated when considering the results of, which is the most dangerous intersection or which is the most dangerous street, and all these findings must be taken with a pinch of salt. Another challenge is, as there is quite a lot of information that is not geocoded (15%), thus the exact location of the crash is unknown. This adds quite a bit of skew to our statistical analysis and over time it might widen this gap. In cases where collisions have happened in the middle of the street between two intersections, the decision on which intersection that data will be mapped too is totally dependent on the NYPD officer that reported the accident. Thus no information on the agreed tie-breaker has been provided. Unspecified data for the Contributing Factors for multiple records affects the efficacy in finding the cause of a majority of the vehicle collision information. Also, there’s another issue we found out wherein we saw there were a lot of accidents happening on highways and bridges interconnecting boroughs, and the metric to decide which borough should be reported for an accident happening midway between such locations is unknown. 7.2 Future Work: There’s a lot that can be done as future work with this project. We could explore the cause of accidents with crime-related datasets and check if there’s some kind of correlation. We could include weather data to analyze the trends and effects of rainfall, snow on traffic accidents. We could also further separate out each policy within vision zero, such as the installation of new speed cameras, and correlate it with the number of violations happening and accidents leading because of those violations to further gain some important inferences. In short, there’s a lot of ways one could explore this dataset further, which needs investing a significant amount of time and effort in research. "]
